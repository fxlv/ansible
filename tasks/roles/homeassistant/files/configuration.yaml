  # unfortunately the developers of HA are not polline the HUE often enough (5sec) for the motion sensors to actually provide decent reaction speed
  # therefore for motion sensors, I poll them separately via the HUE API
  # probably a good idea would be to buy some sort of ZigBee dongle, or I wish the Philips HUE would add support for callbacks/hooks. I'm amazed they don't have it already.
